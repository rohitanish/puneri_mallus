# Puneri Mallus Repository File Lineage

> Generated from a static source-tree audit on 2026-09-14. This document describes purpose, consumers, dependencies, and runtime lineage for every source, configuration, script, and public asset file in the repository, excluding generated `.next/` and installed `node_modules/` contents.
>
> This revision includes recently added event-ticketing, QR-scanning, and repository-audit tooling that was not present in the earlier lineage snapshot.
>
> Static analysis cannot prove runtime consumers for database-provided URLs, browser navigation, uploads, or external systems. Those cases are called out explicitly rather than guessed.

## 1. System Overview

This is a Next.js App Router application for the Puneri Mallus community. The main runtime layers are:

- **Global shell:** `app/layout.tsx` composes `Navbar`, `Preloader`, `AlertProvider`, `Footer`, `ConditionalGate`, analytics, Razorpay, and WhatsApp UI around every route.
- **Pages:** `app/**/page.tsx` files implement public, authentication, football, directory, community, and admin screens.
- **Server endpoints:** `app/api/**/route.ts` files expose HTTP handlers for pages and admin tools.
- **Authentication:** Supabase sessions and users, with Firebase phone authentication used by client-side onboarding and gate flows.
- **Data:** MongoDB/Mongoose for content and support data; Supabase for authentication, profiles, memberships, payments, football, admin authorization, logs, settings, and storage.
- **External services:** Razorpay payments, Nodemailer/Gmail email, Vercel Analytics/Speed Insights, Google-hosted metadata image, and WhatsApp links.
- **Request protection:** `proxy.ts` refreshes Supabase sessions and restricts API access for unauthenticated requests.

## 2. Runtime Lineage

```text
app/layout.tsx
  -> Navbar, Preloader, AlertProvider, Footer, ConditionalGate, WhatsAppTribe
  -> every App Router page
  -> app/globals.css, Supabase/Firebase clients, Vercel analytics, Razorpay script

public pages
  -> client fetches -> app/api/** routes
  -> API routes -> MongoDB/Mongoose, Supabase, Storage, Razorpay, mail

admin pages
  -> app/admin/layout.tsx -> lib/admin.ts -> Supabase authorized_admins
  -> admin UI -> admin/manage/delete/reorder/settings API routes

forms

  -> API handlers
  -> database and Supabase Storage
  -> notification/receipt email through lib/mail.ts
```

## 3. Root Files

### `.env.local`

**Purpose:** Local runtime secrets and environment configuration. Expected values include MongoDB, Supabase, email, site URL, and Razorpay settings.

**Lineage:** Loaded directly by Next.js/server runtime and by `migrate.js`; values are read through `process.env` in server libraries and API routes. It is not imported as source code.

**Important:** This file is secret-sensitive. Its values should never be copied into this documentation, committed, or exposed to client code unless deliberately prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

### `compile.js`

**Purpose:** Repository snapshot utility that walks the source tree and writes a single combined output file for auditing, code packaging, and prompt-generation workflows.

**Lineage:** Run manually with Node; it reads the project directory, skips generated and vendor folders, and emits `compiled_repo.txt`. It is not part of the production app runtime.

### `compiled_repo.txt`

**Purpose:** Generated repository-wide source dump created by `compile.js`.

**Lineage:** Used as an audit artifact for documentation, PR review, and prompt packaging. It is a generated output file rather than an active runtime dependency.

### `.gitignore`

**Purpose:** Defines files Git should omit, normally including dependencies, build output, local environment files, and editor/system artifacts.

**Lineage:** Consumed by Git tooling only. It has no application runtime consumer.

### `REPOSITORY_FILE_LINEAGE.md`

**Purpose:** This repository-wide file lineage and architecture reference.

**Lineage:** Read by developers and documentation tooling. It is not imported or executed by the application.

### `README.md`

**Purpose:** Human-facing project setup and usage documentation.

**Lineage:** Read by developers and repository tooling. It does not execute at runtime. Its documented framework/font details should be checked against the implementation in `package.json` and `app/layout.tsx`.

### `package.json`

**Purpose:** Declares the Next.js/React application metadata, scripts, and direct dependencies.

**Lineage:** npm and Next.js consume it. Scripts provide the development, production build, production start, and lint entry points. Dependencies used by the source include Next, React, Supabase, Firebase, MongoDB/Mongoose, Nodemailer, Razorpay, Tailwind/PostCSS, Vercel analytics, and UI helpers.

### `package-lock.json`

**Purpose:** Pins the complete npm dependency tree and versions.

**Lineage:** npm install/CI consumes it to reproduce `package.json` dependencies. It is not imported by application code.

### `eslint.config.mjs`

**Purpose:** ESLint configuration for Next.js Core Web Vitals and TypeScript rules.

**Lineage:** Consumed by the lint script/tooling; it does not affect production runtime behavior.

### `global.d.ts`

**Purpose:** Global TypeScript declaration scaffold. It is currently empty.

**Lineage:** TypeScript includes declaration files through `tsconfig.json`; there are no active declarations in this file.

### `migrate.js`

**Purpose:** Manual MongoDB migration script that transfers data from `puneri_mallus` to `punerimallus`.

**Lineage:** Run manually with Node, loads `.env.local`, connects to MongoDB, and copies database content. It is not imported by the Next.js application and has no route consumer.

### `next-env.d.ts`

**Purpose:** Next-generated TypeScript environment declarations.

**Lineage:** Included by TypeScript and references generated route types under `.next/dev/types/routes.d.ts`. It is build/tooling support, not runtime application logic.

### `next.config.ts`

**Purpose:** Next.js configuration for image optimization, allowed remote image hosts, caching, and trailing-slash behavior.

**Lineage:** Consumed by Next.js during development, build, and server startup. It controls whether external images used by pages/components can be optimized.

### `postcss.config.js`

**Purpose:** Legacy PostCSS configuration using Tailwind/autoprefixer.

**Lineage:** Potentially consumed by PostCSS depending on config resolution. It overlaps with `postcss.config.mjs`, creating configuration-selection ambiguity.

### `postcss.config.mjs`

**Purpose:** PostCSS configuration using the Tailwind v4 plugin.

**Lineage:** Consumed by Next.js/PostCSS while processing `app/globals.css` and other styles. Its coexistence with `postcss.config.js` should be understood when diagnosing CSS builds.

### `proxy.ts`

**Purpose:** Request middleware/proxy for Supabase session refresh and API authorization.

**Lineage:** Next.js discovers it as the project proxy entry point. It calls Supabase server helpers, refreshes cookies, permits selected unauthenticated routes, and blocks non-whitelisted unauthenticated API requests.

### `tailwind.config.js`

**Purpose:** Tailwind configuration, including source content paths and the `brandRed` color.

**Lineage:** Consumed by Tailwind/PostCSS while processing class names used throughout `app/` and `components/`.

### `tsconfig.json`

**Purpose:** TypeScript compiler configuration, included source patterns, strictness, and path aliases such as `@/*`.

**Lineage:** Consumed by TypeScript, ESLint, Next.js, and editor language services. The aliases enable imports such as `@/components/Navbar`.

## 4. App Shell and Styling

### `app/layout.tsx`

**Purpose:** Root layout and global document shell. Defines metadata, Inter font loading, dark HTML/body styling, global providers, navigation, preloader, footer, path gate, analytics, Razorpay checkout loading, and WhatsApp CTA.

**Lineage:** Next.js applies it above every descendant route. It imports `app/globals.css`, `Navbar`, `Preloader`, `AlertProvider`, `Footer`, `ConditionalGate`, `WhatsAppTribe`, Vercel analytics, and `next/script`.

### `app/globals.css`

**Purpose:** Global Tailwind/style layer, black/red theme variables, scrolling/background behavior, reduced-motion handling, mobile blur adjustments, and reusable utility styles.

**Lineage:** Imported by `app/layout.tsx`, so it applies globally to all pages and components.

### `app/icon.png`

**Purpose:** Next.js convention-based application favicon/icon.

**Lineage:** Discovered automatically by Next.js from the `app` directory and emitted as application metadata. No source import is required.

**Lineage:** Used by `app/api/contact/route.ts` for creation and `app/api/admin/support/route.ts` for administration; depends on `lib/mongodb.ts` connection setup.

## 11. Public Assets

Public assets are served from the site root by Next.js. Their lineage is usually through string paths such as `/about/...`, `/events/...`, `/founders/...`, or `/videos/...`, rather than TypeScript imports. Dynamic CMS URLs may refer to Supabase Storage instead.

### Root public assets

## 12. Data and Environment Dependencies

Expected environment variables observed from the source include:

- `MONGODB_URI`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `EMAIL_USER`
- `EMAIL_PASS`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
- Firebase client configuration variables used by `lib/firebase.ts`

Observed MongoDB collections include `events`, `community_circles`, `mallu_mart`, `partners`, `team_members`, `site_settings`, `profiles`, and popup/ad data. Observed Supabase tables include profiles, memberships, payments, football registration/team data, `authorized_admins`, `admin_audit_logs`, `directory_owners`, and `app_settings`. Storage buckets include `assets`, `events`, `community`, `partners`, `ads`, and `mallu-mart`.

## 13. Static-Analysis Limits and Unresolved Lineage

- Database document contents, complete schemas, indexes, policies, RLS behavior, and actual records require runtime/database inspection.
- Dynamic media and links returned by slider, gallery, social, popup, community, event, partner, and Mallu Mart APIs cannot be mapped to a specific file statically.
- Runtime `slide.buttonLink`, ticket URLs, map links, websites, Instagram handles, and database-provided navigation are data-dependent.
- `EventGlimpse`, `SectionDivider`, `TicketServiceTable`, and `ChatWidget` have no confirmed active static consumers; `ChatWidget` is commented out.
- `hero-bg.jpeg`, starter SVGs, several event images, `hero-video.mp4`, and `footback.png` have no confirmed static source consumers and may be legacy, externally referenced, or CMS-related.
- `.next/` is generated build output and `node_modules/` is installed dependency content, so neither is documented file by file. Their source-level entry points are documented through `next-env.d.ts`, `package.json`, and the configuration files above.
- Both PostCSS config files exist. Which one is selected depends on tooling/config resolution and should be verified during a build if CSS behavior is unexpected.
